    "According to Yann LeCun, “adversarial training is the coolest thing since sliced bread”. I’m inclined to believe so because I don’t think sliced bread ever created this much buzz and excitement within the deep learning community. Generative Adversarial Networks are a set of models that basically learn to create synthetic data that is similar to input data it's given. In more formal terms, a GAN is a generative model that learns the probability distribution (or data distribution) of the training examples it is given. From this distribution, we can then create sample outputs. GANs have seen their largest progress with image training examples, but this idea of modeling data distributions is one that can be applied with other forms of input.In the case described in today’s post, we’ll be creating a GAN that learns to generate synthetic, yet readable, images of MNIST digits.

    "The discriminative model has the task of determining whether a given image looks natural (an image from the dataset) or looks like it has been artificially created. This is basically a binary classifier that will take the form of a normal convolutional neural network (CNN).  The task of the generator is to create natural looking images that are similar to the original data distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be thought of as a zero-sum or minimax two player game. The analogy used in the paper is that the generative model is like “a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce and use fake currency” while the discriminative model is like “the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency”. The generator is trying to fool the discriminator while the discriminator is trying to not get fooled by the generator. As the models train through alternating optimization, both methods are improved until a point where the “counterfeits are indistinguishable from the genuine articles”. There are specific game theory concepts that prove there is indeed an equilibrium to this game where the generator gets so good that the discriminator outputs a probability of ½ for every input. "

    "Now that we have our discriminator defined, let’s take a look at the generator module. For this, we’ll be basing our model off the generator introduced in the DCGAN paper (link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434v2.pdf). You can think of the generator as being a kind of reverse ConvNet. With CNNs, the goal is to transform a 2 or 3 dimensional matrix of pixel values into a single probability. A generator, however, seeks to take a d-dimensional noise vector and upsample it to become a 28 x 28 image. This upsampling is done through a convolutional transpose (or deconvolution) layer. ReLUs and Batch Norm are then used to stabilize the outputs of each layer. "

The purpose of a placeholder is basically to tell Tensorflow \"We're going to input in our random z vector later, but for now, we're going to define this placeholder variable instead\". It lets Tensorflow know about the size of the inputs beforehand. The shape of the placeholder will be None x z_dimensions. The None keyword means that the value can be determined at session runtime. We normally have None as our first dimension so that we can have variable batch sizes (With a batch size of 16, the input to the generator would be 16 x 100).

Without the right hyperparameters, network architecture, and training procedure, there is a high chance that either the generator or discriminator will overpower the other. A common case of this is the situation where the generator is able to find a flaw in the discriminator by repeatedly outputting an image that fits the data distribution the discriminator is looking for, but is nowhere close to being a readable MNIST digit. The generator has collapsed onto a single point, and therefore we won’t output a variety of digits.

    "In this post, we showed how two networks were able to play a minimax game in order to capture the data distribution of the MNIST digits and generate similar looking samples. With applications in video frame prediction, text-image mappings, and more, GANs are definitely the hottest topic in deep learning. Hopefully, with this tutorial, you’ve gained a better understanding of how these networks work in practice and how you can build your own with Tensorflow!\n"
